	<h1>Time Complexity and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases making it efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b>algorithm requires to solve a computational problem concerning the input size  and it becomes O(n)</p>
