	<h1>Time Complexicity and Space Complexicity</h1>
	<p>Time Complexity is a fundamental concept in computer science that measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as the input size increases and it is more efficient</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to solve a computational problem concerning the input size it is denoted by: O(n)</p>
